# NetWhat

### 42 Cursus project focused on acquiring basic knowledge about networks and network protocols. You can find the subjects about this project in [English](Subject/en.subject.pdf) or [Spanish](Subject/es.subject.pdf).  

### Really it was a web test about it, with 30 questions to be answered in less than 10 minutes. You can find a test with similar questions in [here](Test/), if you need info about how it works please review the tester [README](Test/README.md) file.

### Currently this project is deprecated and not available for the new students since February 2021.

### The answers file is the key to access to my answers in the 42 intranet.
